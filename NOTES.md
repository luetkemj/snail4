Create a pile container entity where there are multiple things on the ground. Put all the things into the pile. If it is empty is removed and deleted.

Chests should not become a pile when sorted through but instead all the things that were in it should go back.

Corpses should become piles? Not sure yet. But this fun would be nice to have...

# Todo

- [ ] Multiple dungeon floors

- [ ] shops
- [ ] sort items in container UI
- [ ] some variablility to init rendering of dungeon - not static numbers of entities as we currently have
